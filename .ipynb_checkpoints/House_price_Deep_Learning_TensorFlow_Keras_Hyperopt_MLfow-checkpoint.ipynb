    "The Purpose of my repos is to learn, in this repo I try to learn how to use TensorFlow Keras, Hyperopt, MLflow to develop a deep learning model\n",
    "\n",
    "It includes the following steps: \n",
    "- STEP 1: DATA PREP\n",
    "Load and preprocess data \n",
    "- STEP 2: Neural Network Model\n",
    "        Part 1. Create a neural network model with TensorFlow Keras and view training with inline TensorBoard\n",
    "        Part 2. Perform automated hyperparameter tuning with Hyperopt and MLflow and use autologging to save results\n",
    "        Part 3. Use the best set of hyperparameters to build a final model\n",
    "        Part 4. Register the model in MLflow and use the model to make predictions\n",
