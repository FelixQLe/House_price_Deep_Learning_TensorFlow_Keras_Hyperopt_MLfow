# House_price_Deep_Learning_TensorFlow_Keras_Hyperopt_MLfow
The Purpose of my repos is to learn, in this repo I try to learn how to use TensorFlow Keras, Hyperopt, MLflow to develop a deep learning model

It includes the following steps:
STEP 1: DATA PREP
Load and preprocess data
STEP 2: Neural Network Model
  Part 1. Create a neural network model with TensorFlow Keras and view training with inline TensorBoard
  Part 2. Perform automated hyperparameter tuning with Hyperopt and MLflow and use autologging to save results
  Part 3. Use the best set of hyperparameters to build a final model
  Part 4. Register the model in MLflow and use the model to make predictions
  
This repo follow instructions notebooks provided on DataBricks websites
