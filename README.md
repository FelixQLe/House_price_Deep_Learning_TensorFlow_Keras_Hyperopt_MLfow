### Error Python worker exited unexpected (crashed)
Update python to version 3.10.9, because SparkTrial() is only compatible with python version => 3.10
## -------------
The Purpose of my repos is to learn, in this repo I try to learn how to use and configurate TensorFlow Keras, Hyperopt, MLflow to develop a deep learning model

It includes the following steps:
- STEP 1: DATA PREP
Load and preprocess data
- STEP 2: Neural Network Model
  - Part 1. Create a neural network model with TensorFlow Keras and view training with inline TensorBoard
  - Part 2. Perform automated hyperparameter tuning with Hyperopt and MLflow and use autologging to save results
  - Part 3. Use the best set of hyperparameters to build a final model
  - Part 4. Register the model in MLflow and use the model to make predictions
  
This repo follow instructions notebooks provided on DataBricks websites
